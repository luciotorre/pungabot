Authentication

Actually the authentication is based in user - password - hostmask basis.
Once you're authenticated, the bot saves your current hostmask in the authdb, and you
can manually change that hostmask to something more generic if your hostmask is changed
dynamically (ie an adsl connection)

Also, the bot handle different levels for the users and bots added to the authdb, which
can be seen in the auto-op module, which only autoop bots and admins (users with level 
greater than 4)

Actual levels

1 - user
2 - user
3 - admin
4 - bot
5 - master

punga only contains a method called checkValidHostmask which verify based on the user
hostmask if the user is in the database and also if he did authentication, and return
the user level.

all the authentication commands are handled by the module_auth.

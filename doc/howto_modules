All modules are located on the modules/ directory.
They should be named "module_<name>.py"

There are two special methods init and finalize, these are called just after
the module has loaded and just before the bot shuts down (or is rehashed)

Methods:
========

Globally available:

- getUrl(url)

    Returns a dict of bs, info, content. bs is a BeautifulSoup 
    object with the page already inserted, info contains the url
    headers and content contains the page contents.
    This method should be used when the module intends to do
    something with the contained HTML/XML, this reduces unnecessary
    traffic to websites considerably. All results fetched via getUrl
    are cached internally for a few minutes.

- getNick(user)

    Returns only the nickname of a given user. Manly used to answer
    correctly to user requests.

- getHostmask(user)

    Returns only the hostmask of a given used. Used for authentication

- twapi()

    The complete tweepy api, already logged to twitter.

Commands via bot.<method>:

- checkValidHostmask(user)

    Check if the user is authenticated (or auto-authenticated) to the bot, 
    based on his hostmask. 
    Returns the user level, or False if the user is not authenticated

- say(channel, message)

    Say something to a channel.

- mode(self, chan, set, modes, limit = None, user = None, mask = None)

- join(self, channel, key=None)
- leave(self, channel, reason=None)
- kick(self, channel, user, reason=None)
- topic(self, channel, topic=None)
- quit(self, message)
- notice(self, user, message)
- away(self, message)
- setNick(self, nickname)
- me(self, channel, action)
